Software engineering, a course that I take in fifth semester of my college credit. The course is basically learn how to make a proper application, better than the Web programming project.

In this course, we have to make a project that have some business in it. So my group make a Clothing line production based on website called Vendorin.aja. The group itself consist of 5 people with each role like Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer, UI/UX Designer. My role is UI/UX which fundamentally I have the responsibilities to make all page of the website.

The project went well, but we didn't have enough experience in deployment, so the project just ended up in <a href="https://github.com/hafidhakhdan/vendorinaja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this repo</a>

thank you,
have a good day,
